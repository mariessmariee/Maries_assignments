# My First GitHub Repository

Hi! I created this Repository as part of a learning exercise.

## ðŸ““ A note from me

I wasnâ€™t sure what meaningful content to put here â€” most of my actual notes are on paper. I couldâ€™ve asked ChatGPT for help, but thatâ€™s not allowed for this task.

So, here it is. I hope this still counts.

Thanks for understanding! ðŸ˜Š
